# Bamboo

A posture tracking product. 

Our team at Imperial College London created a smart IoT device that is able to monitor your personal posture information using a flex sensor [SEN-08606] together with a Raspberry Pi, ultimately providing useful feedback to help improve/condition one's posture habits.

This repository includes all of the software required for the development of the IoT sensor.

## Usage

Begin with a git clone of the repository:
`$ git clone https://github.com/zenasgram/Bamboo.git`
